# aiforgoodhackathon
I heard about this hackathon from my friend, and it seemed interesting to me so i want to try it. the porpose is to use machine learning to support climate action by predicting and preventing forest disasters.

I think my goal will first be to develop the images, I think this will be challenging because i have not worked with satellite imagery before.
